## How This Works

When your agent sees this file with `state: not_started` or `in_progress`, it knows to help you complete setup.

This agent has already learned from past interactions. You can:

1. **Review and edit** — Update any answers below
2. **Continue answering** — Fill in remaining questions
3. **Skip for now** — Agent works immediately, learns from conversation
